# TDD Practice Project: FizzBuzz, Word Reordering, Calculator.


This project serves as a fundamental practice in Test-Driven Development (TDD) using vitest and react testing library for testing. It encompasses three distinct exercises: FizzBuzz, Word Reordering, and Calculator, each implemented following TDD principles.


## Overview

The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate proficiency in TDD methodologies through the implementation of basic algorithms and functionalities. It consists of the following exercises:


### FizzBuzz: 

✅ Implement a function that takes a number as input and returns "Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3, "Buzz" if divisible by 5, and "FizzBuzz" if divisible by both 3 and 5.

The FizzBuzz exercise tests the ability to write a simple algorithm to identify numbers divisible by 3, 5, or both, and return the corresponding string representation. Additionally, it includes tests to ensure that only numerical values are accepted as input parameters, verifying the robustness of the implementation.

### Word Reordering: 

✅ Develop a function that rearranges the letters of a word while preserving their original order. For instance, "hello" would become "ehllo".

In this exercise, a function is developed to reorder the letters of a word while maintaining their original order. The implementation focuses on string manipulation and algorithmic logic. Additionally, thorough testing ensures that the function accepts only alphabetical characters, checks that both parameters have the same length, and verifies that they contain the same number of unique letters.

### Calculator: 

✅ Create a basic calculator functionality that supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.

The Calculator exercise involves building a basic calculator functionality supporting arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The goal is to create a functional and user-friendly calculator interface.


## Continuous Integration
Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines are set up to automatically run the test suite whenever changes are pushed to the repository. This ensures that any modifications to the codebase maintain the integrity of the application and do not introduce regressions.


## Conclusion
This TDD practice provides me valuable hands-on experience in writing testable code, designing robust algorithms, and gaining familiarity with testing frameworks and methodologies. It serves as a foundational step towards mastering software development practices and principles.
