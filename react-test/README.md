# Technical test for React.
Add and remove elements from a list (React)

This React technical test project, constructed with Vite.js for project setup and ViteTest for testing, aims to develop an application enabling users to interactively manage a list of items. Key functionalities include:

- Addition of Elements: The application provides users with a text field and a button to add elements to a list. Upon entering text into the input field and clicking the button, the text content is appended as a new item to the list.

- Removal of Elements: Each item in the list is interactive, allowing users to remove it by clicking on it. When any item is clicked, it is promptly removed from the list.

- Functionality and Usability: The primary focus of the application is on functionality and usability rather than visual design. While the interface should be intuitive and user-friendly, the emphasis is placed on ensuring seamless interactions and efficient list management.

- TypeScript Implementation: The entire codebase of the application is developed in TypeScript, adhering to strong typing principles and leveraging TypeScript's benefits for enhanced code quality and maintainability.

- End-to-End Testing: The application includes comprehensive end-to-end (E2E) testing to verify the functionality of the user interactions. E2E tests are designed to simulate user actions and verify that the application behaves as expected from a user's perspective.

- Unit Testing of Hook: The hook responsible for adding and removing items from the list is thoroughly tested using unit tests. Unit tests ensure that the hook functions correctly under various scenarios and edge cases, providing confidence in its reliability and correctness.

Key concepts:

- Create an app in React that implements a text field and button to add an element.
- When the button is clicked, the text in the input field should then be added into a list of items.
- Additionally, every time any item in the list is clicked, it must be removed from the list.
- Give importance to functionality and usability, rather than visual design.
- The code must be entirely developed in Typescript.
