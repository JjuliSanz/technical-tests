# Catfacts Technical test.

This React technical test project, built with Vite.js for project setup and Playwright for testing, aims to create an application that interacts with external APIs to deliver engaging cat-related content to users. 


## Overview

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate proficiency in React development and testing. It includes the following completed requirements.


## Key functionalities:

- Random Cat Fact Retrieval: The application retrieves a random cat fact from an external API source. This cat fact serves as the basis for subsequent operations.

- First Word Extraction: After retrieving the random cat fact, the application extracts the three first word from the fact. This words acts as a key element for further interaction.

- Cat Picture Display: Utilizing the extracted words, the application fetches and displays a corresponding picture of a cat.

- Additionally, the project incorporates an end-to-end (E2E) testing suite to ensure the seamless functionality of the application. The E2E tests cover various scenarios, validating the proper retrieval of cat facts, accurate word extraction, and correct display of cat pictures.
