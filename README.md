# Technical Practice Projects Repository

This repository is a collection of various projects that have personally helped me practice and improve my skills in developing and testing web applications with React. Each project focuses on different aspects of web development and has provided ample opportunities for honing my skills.

Within each folder, you will find the individual projects accompanied by their respective descriptions, explaining each test or practice exercise in detail.

Happy coding and happy testing! 🚀🔍
